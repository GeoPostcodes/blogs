# Import location data to Salesforce: A step-by-Step guide

## Objective of the tutorial

Adding location data to Salesforce lets you leverage features like its [territory planning](https://www.salesforce.com/products/sales-cloud/tools/territory-planning/) for creating and managing sales territories, optimizing sales coverage, and improving efficiency.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to add location data from [GeoPostcodes](https://www.geopostcodes.com/) to [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/).

## Case explanation

Youâ€™ll import account data for a fictitious Brazil-based coffee company using Salesforce's data import wizard.

You will see how to:

- obtain location data from GeoPostcodes and import it into Salesforce
- map the location data to account information for a fictitious coffee company in Brazil
- use the mapped data to filter and segment your `Accounts` data
