# How to Calculate Distance Between Two Zip Codes in Python

## Objective of the tutorial

By the end of this article, you will be able to calculate distances between two zip codes in [Python](https://www.python.org/) like a pro. You’ll learn the basics of zip codes and geospatial data, we’ll introduce some Python libraries that can help you with distance calculation, and guide you through a step-by-step example of how to use them.

## Case explanation

We will combine GeoPy's geodesic calculations with PyProj's custom projections to showcase a comprehensive approach to distance measurement.

The two libraries showcase the Python tools for tackling diverse geospatial challenges, ensuring optimal accuracy and context-awareness in distance calculations.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you will need

- a **computer with a Python development environment**; I use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), which comes with the [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution, but other editors like JupyterLab will also work.
- The script [distance_between_2_zips.ipynb](distance_between_2_zips.ipynb).
- The provided [zip code sample CSVs](https://www.geopostcodes.com/resources/) downloaded to your computer.
